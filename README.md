# Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This project is a "template" designed to provide a starting point for new software development projects. It includes a basic structure and common configurations that can be customized to fit the specific needs of your project. The template aims to streamline the initial setup process, allowing developers to focus on implementing core functionality rather than spending time on boilerplate code. Specifically, this template provides a model for creating a new app with a modern self-hosted software suite, including both frontend and backend components with a database.
